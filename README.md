# Deep Math iLTurbo
Large calculations using own formulas. I call this script deep mathematics because it is very useful for calculations and analysis in the field of cryptography.

Describe any formula from mathematics courses in lines of code and get the answer from one file to another file.

# Scripts:

DeepMathDEC_iLTurbo.py - Decimal format

DeepMathHEX_iLTurbo.py - Hex format

# Installation:


Create a list to file: List.txt

git clone https://github.com/ilturbo/DeepMath_iLTurbo.git

cd DeepMath_iLTurbo

sudo apt install python3

chmod +x DeepMathDEC_iLTurbo.py

./DeepMathDEC_iLTurbo.py

Enjoy the process!

The result be saved to the file: Save.txt
